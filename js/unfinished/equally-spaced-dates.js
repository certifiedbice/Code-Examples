// Write a function in javascript that takes a start_date, end_date, 
// x - returns an array of x equally spaced dates in between them. 
// For example, given 2016-01-01 00:00:00, 2016-01-02 00:00:00, 24 - 
// you'd return an array of each hour between the 2 dates. 
// Here are your variables: start_date = 2016-01-01 00:00:00; 
// end_date = 2016-01-08 00:00:00; x = 42; *
